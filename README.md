### Summary
Thanks to studying at a technical university and my work experience I learned to be resourceful and accurate in the tasks carried out, as well as to quickly adapt to new working conditions. I studied extramural because I wanted to combine my studies with gaining work experience. I am looking for a job that will allow me to use the acquired knowledge in practice and to develop myself.  During my studies, I learned to work effectively in a group during various projects, in contrast to the situation at work, where I was held accountable for my tasks individually.
